# CSE549

CSE_549_bsg_manycore_eva.cpp - The C++ modifications are to be done here. Check out the functions "default_eva_get_x_coord_dram", "default_eva_get_y_coord_dram" & "default_eva_get_epa_dram". The different hash functions have been added to these.

CSE_549_bsg_manycore_dram_hash_function.v - The RTL modifications are to be done here. The different hash functions have been commented out.

Uncomment the same set of functions in both RTL & CPP and then run the different benchmarks to profile them. As an exmaple, PEARSON HASHING hashing has been uncommented by default
